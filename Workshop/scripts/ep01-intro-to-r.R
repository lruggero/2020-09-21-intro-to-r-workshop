# What does: 11 + 1 / 6  evaluate to ?

# Solution:
11+(1/6)

# Calculate 10 plus 2 all divided by 3 and then squared

# Solution:
((10+2)/3)^2


# <- alt + minus sign is the shortcut to get this store function below

b <- 5              # assign 5 to b

a                   # so what's the value of OBJECT "a"
b                   # ... and what's b

a + b               # we can add them together just like numbers

# What happens if we change a and then re-add a and b? [Hint: Try it now]
#
# Does it work if you just change a in the script and then add a and b? [Hint: Try it]
#
# Did you still get the same answer after you changed a? 
# If so, why do you think that might be?
#
# We can also assign the result of a + b to a new variable, c. 
# How would you do this?
#
# Solution:

# (a+b) <- c (I tried this and it didn't work)
# 12 <- c  (I tried this and it didn't work)
#because the one you're assigning a variable TO needs to be on the left

c <- a + b

# Topic: Displaying results
#

weight_lb <- 55    # doesn't print anything
(weight_lb <- 55)  # but putting parenthesis () around an expression makes it assign and also display

2.20462 * weight_lb

# How do we do we know if our answers are correct ? 
# [Hint: <highlight> [ALT][ENTER] (just run "mass" or "age" again to check what the currently stored value is)

#
# Topic: Comments
#

# Comments (like this one) are usually helpful

     # they can also be indented (and on the same line as a code)

# They should be supportive (not redundant e.g. "this is a comment")

# 
# Exercise
# 
#
# Add explanatory comments to the following lines of code

ft <- 3           # assigning that length in feet = 3
in <- ft * 12     # conversion from feet to inches
cms <- in * 2.54  # 2.54 isthe conversion factor between inches and centimetres
m = cms / 100     # assigning that metres is cms divided by 100

#
# Topic: Functions and Arguments

sqrt(2) #sqrt is the name of the function, 2 is the 'argument'
a <- 64
sqrt(a) # can't run this of course until you assign a number to a
abs(-23.3) #absolue value
round(3.14159)
pi

# Getting help about particular functions 
?round #will tell you about the round funciton

# this doesn't work - R automatically converts the number 4.5 into a "textual representation". So it's not longer the number 4.5, it's a text entry.

# Exercise
# --------
#
# Weâ€™ve seen that vectors can be of type character, 
# numeric (or double), integer, and logical. 
#
# But what happens if we try to mix these types in a single vector?
#
# eg:
#
#   thing <- c("some characters", 3.141, 100, TRUE)
thing <- c("some characters", 3.141, 100, TRUE)
#   thing - this tells us that's its converted all of these into character strings because everything is now in inverted commas
#   class(thing) - running this tells us that it has made it a character string - if you were unsure what type of string it was
#
# What will happen in each of these examples?
#
#   num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")
num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")
num_char # when I run this then it tells me that it's made them all characters
class(num_char) # confirms that it's converted to character string

#Ctrl SHift C - it gets rid of the comment symbol

#   num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)

#   char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)

#   tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, "4")
tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, "4")
tricky 

#
# [Hint: use class() to check the data type of your objects]
#
# Can you explain why you think it happens?

# --------
# Exercise
# --------
# How many values in combined_logical are "TRUE" (ie character 4 characters)
# in the following example:
#   
#   num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
#   char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
#   combined_logical <- c(num_logical, char_logical)

# Topic: Subsetting vectors
# Presented by: Evan Matthews

animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals
animals[2] # says just tell me the second one in the vector - must use sq brackets
animals[c(3, 2)] # says just tell me the third then the second one in the vector 

more_animals <- animals[c(1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4)]
more_animals

# Conditional subsetting
weight_g <- c(21,   34,    39,   54,   55)
weight_g[   c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)] # instead of giving it numbers, I can tell it whether I want each of those elements or not

weight_g > 50 #I'm asking is weight greater thatn 50 for al the values in the vector? (it will tell me [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE)
weight_g[weight_g > 50]

weight_g[weight_g < 30 | weight_g > 50] # vertical bar = "OR" function # show me all the values that are less than 30 OR more than 50

weight_g[weight_g >= 30 & weight_g == 21] # show me al the vvalued which are less than or equal to 30 AND equal to 21



animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[animals == "cat" | animals == "rat"] # returns both rat and cat

animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat") #Check if the thing I'm interested in (animals) is in this current set?
animals[animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat")] #in this animal array, give me all ones that are in this subset


# Challenge
#
# Can you explain  why 
#
#  "four" > "five" 
#
# returns TRUE?
#
# Answer:
# because they are character strings "chars" - the comparison operator > < etc means alphabetically and fo does come after fi alphabetically

"z" > "a"
"z" > "A" # in other languages the case can cause different answers. But R will evaluate regardless of case




# Topic: Missing data (NA - Not Available)

heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6) #denote missing data with NA - R doesn't care at this point
#but if you try to run functions with a NA, it can cause problems

mean(heights) # will return "NA" - this is the conservative answer because you can't average thigns when the NA could be anything!
max(heights)
mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE) #add an extra argument to say that you want to means, but "remove the NA values"
max(heights, na.rm = TRUE)

is.na(heights) # show me - is there an NA in here? ("is.na" checks the argument for NAs) - FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE
!is.na(heights) # show me which ones are values in here (no NAs) - TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
#these True values now correspond to which values you want to keep

heights[!is.na(heights)] # use that thing we just figured out to select out the interger values only - give me all the values in the heights vector which are not NAs - 2 4 4 6

na.omit(heights) # loost the plot on what this was
heights[complete.cases(heights)]
heights

#
# Exercise (extended)
#
#
# Using this vector of heights in inches, create a new vector 
# with the NAs removed.
# 
#   heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)

heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)
!is.na(heights) # show me which ones are values in here (no NAs) 
na.omit(heights)

#returned this: 63 69 60 65 68 61 70 61 59 64 69 63 63 72 65 64 70 63 65

#
# Solution

# Use the function median() to calculate the median of the heights vector.
#
# Solution

median(na.omit(heights))
#OR
median(heights,na.rm = TRUE)
# we have to omit the NAs to calculate this, then it will run the medians


# Use R to figure out how many people in the set are taller than 67 inches.
#
# [Hint: R has a builtin function called length() that tells you 
# how many values are in a vector
